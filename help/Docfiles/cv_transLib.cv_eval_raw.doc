\DOC cv_eval_raw

\TYPE {cv_eval_raw : term -> thm}

\SYNOPSIS
Evaluates closed terms with {cv_computeLib} using translations from {cv_transLib}

\LIBRARY
cv_transLib

\DESCRIBE
Exactly the same as {cv_transLib.cv_eval}, except that {cv_eval_raw} omits the potentially
expensive evaluation out of the {:cv} type.

\FAILURE
Exactly the same as teh failures of {cv_transLib.cv_eval}.

\EXAMPLE

{
> cv_trans rich_listTheory.REPLICATE;
Equations stored under "cv_REPLICATE_def".
Induction stored under "cv_REPLICATE_ind".
Finished translating REPLICATE, stored in cv_REPLICATE_thm
val it = (): unit
> cv_eval “REPLICATE 3 (3:num)”;
val it = ⊢ REPLICATE 3 3 = [3; 3; 3]: thm
> cv_eval_raw “REPLICATE 3 (3:num)”;
val it =
   ⊢ REPLICATE 3 3 =
     to_list cv$c2n (Pair (Num 3) (Pair (Num 3) (Pair (Num 3) (Num 0)))): thm
}
