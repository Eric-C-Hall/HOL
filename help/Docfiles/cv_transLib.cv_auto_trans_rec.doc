\TYPE {cv_auto_trans_rec : thm -> tactic -> unit}

\SYNOPSIS
Translates functional definitions to the {cv_compute} subset of HOL.

\LIBRARY
cv_transLib

\DESCRIBE
This is a recursive version of {cv_transLib.cv_trans_rec}. If the
{cv_transLib.cv_trans_rec}-translation of the given HOL function
encounters untranslated constants, then {cv_transLib.cv_auto_trans}
will be called on each of the definitions of the not-yet-translated
constants. The auto-functions are sometimes able to translate
functions that mention higher-order functions, such as {MAP}.

\FAILURE
When the recursive translations produce a precondition that the
automation is unable to prove automatically, or the provided tactic
is insufficient for proving the termination goal arising from the
top-level translator-defined {:cv} function, or
{cv_transLib.cv_termination_tac} is insufficient for proving
the termination goal of recursively translated functions.
In case the termination goal is not proved, then the problematic
goal is pushed to the goal stack.

\EXAMPLE
See {cv_transLib.cv_auto_trans} and {cv_transLib.cv_trans_rec} for
relevant examples.

\COMMENTS
Designed to produce definitions suitable for evaluation by {cv_transLib.cv_eval}.
